The idea of being an inventor has been my ideal career for as long as I can remember. Being an inventor requires at minimum the ability to understand the process and knowledge that goes into manifesting an idea into something tangible.

I've had various jobs from sales to warehouse work but none of them were fulfilling which created dissonance within myself. I believe this was because deep down inside I knew they weren't jobs I could see myself doing for a long time and being happy about it.

None of the jobs were allowing me to excersize my mind, nor did they give me a sense of steady growth. With that said, Software Engineering tests my ability to problem solve. I recognize learning the skills to be a software engineer is invaluable to the pursuit of following my passion for inventing.
